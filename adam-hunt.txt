Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
            Block: displayed as a rectangle - takes up full width available
            Inline: can be within block - only takes up space necessary to display content

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
             The element will be positioned absolutely in relation to the parent element.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
            Combination of inline + relative positioning.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
            block: <p> <div> <nav>
            inline: <a> <br>
            inline-block: <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
            The box model is a way for html to add structure and separation to the content within a web page. Within the box model you can edit content edge, padding edge, border edge and margin edge. You can use 'content-box' within the 'box-sizing' property to specifically define width.
